# Crypto-Web-Screener
Based on the work from hackingthemarkets/candlestick-screener, but connected to Binance through python_binance. You'll need a working API key from Binance to utilize it.

For the datasets, I was limited on upload it all. Please navigate to /Snapshot in the browser and wait for the tickers to load.
